You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int temp=0;
        int a=0,b=1;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            temp=a+b;
            a=b;
            b=temp;
        }    
        return temp;
    }
}
