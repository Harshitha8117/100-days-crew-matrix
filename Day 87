You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

Solution:
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int count=0;
        String word="";
        while(count<word1.length()||count<word2.length()){
            if(count<word1.length()){
                word+=word1.charAt(count);
            }
            if(count<word2.length()){
                word+=word2.charAt(count);
            }
            count++;
        }
        return word;
    }
}
