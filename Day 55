Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int findClosestNumber(int[] nums) {
        int length=nums.length;
        int a[]=new int[length];
        int d=nums[0];
        for(int i=0;i<length;i++){
            if(Math.abs(nums[i])<Math.abs(d) || Math.abs(nums[i])==Math.abs(d) && nums[i]>d)
            d=nums[i];
        }
        return d;
    }
}
